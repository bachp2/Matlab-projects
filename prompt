Does the internal combustion engine have a future? Just this summer, Volvo announced that it will be phasing out cars powered by internal combustion engines over the next two years; starting in 2019, all its cars will be powered by electric motors. A few weeks later, the government in the UK announced that Britain would ban the sale of gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2040. Just a few days ago, the Chinese government said it was working on a plan to ban all fossil fuel vehicles, though no timeline was announced. California may be about to do the same. Is the internal combustion engine on the way out? If so, should we be celebrating? Have electric motors and batteries developed to a point where they are ready to replace combustion engines on a large scale? Do some research on this topic and report your findings.
